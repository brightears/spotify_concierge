## 2025-04-15: AI Chat-Based Playlist Builder Flow

**Prompt:**  
> "Design a chat-based flow that asks for input on business type, target audience, desired brand mood, and time slots, and outputs 6–10 Spotify playlist previews labeled by time of day. Include upgrade options for BMAsia clients (Notify BMAsia) and non-clients (Paid Upgrade)."

**Outcome:**  
- Developed the conversational logic for collecting user inputs.
- Generated code for creating Spotify playlist previews through API calls.
- Defined the UI upgrade options for different user segments.

## 2025-04-15: Redesign Request Flow and Client Portal

**Prompt:**  
> "Build a secure client portal for BMAsia users where they can log in to view their current playlist setups and submit redesign requests for seasonal updates (e.g., Christmas, Chinese New Year). Include options to pre-book these updates."

**Outcome:**  
- Created code for a login-based dashboard.
- Developed forms for submitting redesign requests with scheduling options.
- Implemented internal notification triggers for BMAsia team review.

**Notes:**  
The redesign flow ensures that existing clients have a straightforward method for requesting updates, with manual curation promised by the BMAsia team.

## 2025-04-15: Payment and Upgrade Flow

**Prompt:**  
> "Integrate a payment flow using Stripe for external users who want to upgrade their playlists. On successful payment, extend the playlist by adding 200 curated tracks and deliver the extended playlist within 24 hours."

**Outcome:**  
- Generated a payment integration flow.
- Defined the upgrade option UI in the new playlist flow.
- Set pricing guidelines (e.g., $19–$59 per extended playlist).

**Notes:**  
This prompt differentiates free previews from premium, fully curated playlists, adding a monetization layer to the project.

**Outcome:**  
- Updated the `.windsurfrules` file with clear instructions for code generation.
- Added specific sections on naming conventions, modular architecture, and external API handling.
- Provided guidance to minimize context drift in future code updates.

**Notes:**  
Keeping the custom rules current is crucial for maintaining consistent outputs from Windsurf. This prompt ensures that both developers and the AI work under the same guidelines.
